# Debug Workflow

This workflow helps you systematically debug application issues.

## Steps

1. **Understand the issue**: Ask the user to describe the problem, error messages, or unexpected behavior
2. **Check error logs**: 
   - Review terminal output for error messages
   - Check browser console if it's a frontend issue
   - Review log files if applicable
3. **Identify potential causes**:
   - Syntax errors
   - Missing dependencies
   - Configuration issues
   - Runtime errors
4. **Investigate relevant files**: View and analyze files that might be causing the issue
5. **Propose solutions**: Suggest fixes based on findings
6. **Implement fixes**: Make necessary code changes
7. **Verify the fix**: Run the application to confirm the issue is resolved
