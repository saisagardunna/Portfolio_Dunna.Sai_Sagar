# Search Workflow

This workflow helps you search for files by name or search for specific code patterns.

## Steps

1. **Determine search type**:
   - File search: Looking for files by name
   - Code search: Looking for specific text/patterns in files
2. **Execute search**:
   - For file search: Use `find_by_name` tool
   - For code search: Use `grep_search` tool
3. **Filter results**: Apply appropriate filters (file extensions, directories, etc.)
4. **Present findings**: Show the results in a clear, organized manner
5. **Offer next steps**: Ask if the user wants to view any of the found files or dig deeper
