# View Workflow

This workflow helps you view file contents or explore directory structures.

## Steps

1. **Identify what to view**: Determine if the user wants to view a specific file or explore a directory
2. **Check if path exists**: Use appropriate tools to verify the path exists
3. **View the content**:
   - For files: Use `view_file` or `view_file_outline` to show file contents
   - For directories: Use `list_dir` to show directory structure
4. **Provide context**: Explain what you're showing and offer to dig deeper if needed
