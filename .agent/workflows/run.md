# Run Workflow

This workflow helps you start the development server or run build commands.

## Steps

// turbo-all

1. **Check if already running**: Verify if a dev server is already running in terminals
2. **Determine the command**: 
   - For development: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
   - For build: `npm run build`
   - For preview: `npm run preview`
3. **Execute the command**: Run the appropriate npm script in the project root
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Monitor output**: Check for any errors or confirmation that the server started successfully
5. **Provide access information**: Share the localhost URL (typically http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173)
