        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Sai Sagar Dunna, and I'm an Associate Software Engineer based in Hyderabad, India. 
          I specialize in building production-ready applications using Python (FastAPI, Flask) and React with TypeScript. 
          My passion lies in creating AI-driven products, workflow automation systems, and scalable cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Education & Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) 
          at Malla Reddy University with a CGPA of 8.89. My technical expertise spans across multiple domains:
        </p>
        <p>
          Backend development with Python, FastAPI, and Flask; Frontend development with React and TypeScript;
          AI/ML technologies including NLP, CNN, Deep Learning, and Conversational AI; Cloud infrastructure 
          with AWS (EC2, S3, EBS), Terraform, and Docker; and workflow automation using n8n and various APIs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Projects & Impact</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in learning by building. I've developed a startup business platform serving 10+ customers 
          with 100+ orders delivered, generating consistent revenue. Created an AI mock interview platform 
          helping users prepare for their dream jobs with adaptive questioning. Built a skin cancer detection 
          system achieving 92% accuracy using deep learning CNN models.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work also includes AI-powered travel planning applications, recipe generators, and automated 
          workflow systems handling 1000+ monthly messages across multiple platforms. Each project is 
          designed to solve real problems and create tangible impact.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Certifications</h2>
        <p>
          AWS Certified | Google AI/ML Internship | Deloitte Job Simulation | NPTEL Certified | 
          Python Certification from University of Michigan and University of Pennsylvania
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Technology is not just about writing code—it's about creating solutions that make a real difference. 
          Every project I build is a step toward making technology more accessible, helpful, and impactful. 
          That's what drives me every day. 💡
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Connect With Me</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're looking to collaborate on a project, discuss technology, or just connect, 
          I'm always open to new opportunities and conversations. Let's create something amazing together!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The journey from curiosity to creation isn't always straightforward. Sometimes you're debugging 
          at 2 AM, wondering if it'll ever work. But that's when the magic happens. Every error message 
          is a lesson. Every successful deployment is a victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          And slowly, you're not just writing code—you're solving real problems and making a real impact 
          in people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep building. The impact is worth it. 💫</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I used to think great engineers just ship code.
          Now I know they ship solutions that make lives better.
        </p>
        <p>
          This perspective shift has transformed how I approach software development. It's not about 
          the latest framework or technology stack—it's about understanding problems deeply and 
          creating solutions that truly help people.
